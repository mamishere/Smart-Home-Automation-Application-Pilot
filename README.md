# Smart Home Automation Application Pilot

<p align="justify">
This project was developed as a final project for the <strong>SSE</strong> course taught by <strong>Dr. Habibi</strong> at <strong>Sharif University of Science and Technology</strong>. It is a pilot project implemented on <strong>Figma</strong> to demonstrate the design and functionality of a smart home automation system. The project focuses on enhancing convenience, security, and energy efficiency by conceptualizing the integration of various smart devices and sensors throughout a household. The design leverages modern UI/UX principles and advanced automation features to create a seamless and user-friendly experience.
